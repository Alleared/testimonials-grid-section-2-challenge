              <p>&ldquo;Before joining the bootcamp, I&apos;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful thins about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands&dash;on and I never had to wait long for assistance, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&apos;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full&dash; developer after receiving multiple offers. 100&percnt; recommended&excl;&rdquo;</p>
